# YubeToo README

### YubeToo is a clone of the popular video hosting site, YouTube.  The site currently allows someone to become a user and for users to upload videos with a 'Title Card' to be the 'Preview' of a video before selected.



### Made with the following technologies:
    * Ruby on Rails
    * React and Redux
    * Hosted on Heroku
    * Video and Photo hosting via AWS
